  New in JsonCpp 0.6.0:
  ---------------------

* Compilation

  - LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH environment variables are now propagated to the build
    environment as this is required for some compiler installation.

  - Added support for Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (bug #2930462): 
    The platform "msvc90" has been added.

    Notes: you need to setup the environment by running vcvars32.bat 
    (e.g. MSVC 2008 command prompt in start menu) before running scons.
    
* Value

  - Removed experimental ValueAllocator, it caused static 
    initialization/destruction order issues (bug #2934500). 
    The DefaultValueAllocator has been inlined in code.
    
  - Added support for 64 bits integer. Json::Int and Json::UInt are 
    now 64 bits integers on system that support them (more precisely
    they are of the size of long long, so if it is 128 bits it will
    also work).
    
    Warning: Json::Value::asInt() and Json::Value::asUInt() now returns
    long long. This changes break code that was passing the return value
    to *printf() function.
    
    Notes: you can switch back to the 32 bits only behavior by defining the 
    macro JSON_NO_INT64 (se include/json/config.h).
    
  - The type Json::ArrayIndex is used for indexes of a JSON value array. It
    is an unsigned int (typically 32 bits).
